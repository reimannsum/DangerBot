# DangerBot
these file are the start of three scripts, one bot that will crawl the game and push info to the wiki.
first is a script that checks one type of building page each day to see which building haven't been updated in the past 6 months.
second is a script that checks the Mobile Phone Masts pages to see if they need to be updates current, old, unknown.
third is a script that walks three accounts through the city and records what they see to push updates to the wiki.
